# Prima+ Interview Task

This repository contains an **end-to-end Cypress test** for user profile creation on [iprima.cz](https://www.iprima.cz/).  
The test covers logging in, creating a profile (BÄ›Å¾nÃ½ or DÄ›tskÃ½), verifying its presence, and then cleaning it up to leave the account unchanged.

---

## Features

 **Functionality** â€“ Logs in, creates a profile via UI, and verifies it is visible.  
 **Code Quality** â€“ Organized with Page Object Model (`IprimaPage`) and API helper (`GatewayApi`).  
 **Cleanup** â€“ After the test, the newly created profile(s) are removed using API calls.  
 **Flexibility** â€“ Profile type can be chosen (`BÄ›Å¾nÃ½` or `DÄ›tskÃ½`) via an environment variable.  

---

## Setup

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install

2. **Configure credentials**
    Create a cypress.env.json file in the project root: {
  "E2E_EMAIL": "your-email@example.com", you can use mine that i used for testing - neznikn@gmail.com and password Test123456
  "E2E_PASSWORD": "your-password",
  "PROFILE_TYPE": "bezny"
}
PROFILE_TYPE can be:

"bezny" â†’ creates a BÄ›Å¾nÃ½ profile (default)

"detsky" â†’ creates a DÄ›tskÃ½ profile

**Running the Tests**

Headless run (default: BÄ›Å¾nÃ½) - npm run cy:run

    cy:run:bezny": "cypress run --env PROFILE_TYPE=bezny

    cy:run:detsky": "cypress run --env PROFILE_TYPE=detsky

You can also hard-set it in cypress.env.json by changing PROFILE_TYPE.

**Implementation Notes**

Page Object Model: UI interactions are encapsulated in IprimaPage.

API Integration: GatewayApi is used to fetch and remove profiles (precise cleanup).

Profile Naming: New profiles are prefixed with QA YYYY-MM-DD for uniqueness.

Cleanup Strategy: Compares ULIDs before/after; only new profiles are deleted.

Flexibility: Switch between BÄ›Å¾nÃ½ and DÄ›tskÃ½ by changing PROFILE_TYPE.

time limit - took me about 90-120 minutes with setting up enviroment and stuff.
